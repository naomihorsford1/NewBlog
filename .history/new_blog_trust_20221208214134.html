        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            Trust has many different meanings, yet it is essential in many disciplines. The data visualization discipline is no exception. The crucial factor is whether or not a user believes or has confidence in a visualization. After the user makes that decision, the question becomes how do you measure the trust in that data visualization? We present a research study on trust in visualizations measured using a survey with Likert scales and its results. We have also outlined the study's limitations and provided numerous future research directions.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Trust is a word that has many different meanings in different contexts. The Oxford English Dictionary defines trust as "to have confidence in somebody; to believe that somebody is good, sincere, honest, etc." In the field of social science, Diego Gambetta defined trust as "he described trust as the subjective probability with which a person (or a group) assesses that another person (or a group) will perform a particular action, with this subjective probability influencing a person's own actions" (Morrone & Ranuzzi, 2009, p. 8). According to related works in the information visualization field, "trust is the user's implicit or explicit tendency to rely on a visualization and to build on the information displayed" (Mayr, Hynek, Salisu, & Windhager, 2019, p.1).

            Today, trust in data visualizations is a current and hot topic. Trust is an essential concept in data visualization because it can help avoid the spread of misconception and confusion. The motive behind this study is to understand and measure trust in terms of data visualization. Other disciplines research trust thoroughly. However, there is very little research done on trust in data visualization. Most of the research done in this area of trust is recent. Furthermore, trust has been measured in other disciplines using measures like the prisoner's dilemma and the classic trust games, but measuring trust in data visualizations is even more sparsely researched. Measuring trust is vital in the data visualization community because trust was identified "as one of the top-10 challenges for visual analytics". (Mayr, Hynek, Salisu, & Windhager, 2019, p.1). Yet, trust is a complex concept to measure because it is multi-dimensional. Trust has many different aspects, such as understanding, creditability, and the user's behavioral intentions. Also, a user's trust in data visualizations can change over time, which adds complexity of time to this concept. In addition to trust being a complex concept, visualizations have many components, such as wording, colors, sourcing, and layout. The computer science and data visualization disciplines do not have a standard definition, system of design, tool, or measure for trust. Therefore, the answer to trust in the data visualization community is still being discovered. There has yet to be a universal quantitative measure for trust in data visualizations. This exact issue has led to this research project.
